### Hi there 👋
:airplane::space_invader: I'm an aerospace engineer in love with all the branches of engineering.:sunglasses:

🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a good Back-end Dev.
So i'm studying C, C++, C#, Java Script and Rust, just to keep myself busy.
🔭 I'm corrently expanding my knowledge on 11ty as a mean to deploy fast and easy webpages for info/blogs.
